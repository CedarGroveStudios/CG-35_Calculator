# Retro RPN Calculator
The CG-35 is a CircuitPython emulation of one of the first affordable scientific hand-held calculators. The calculator works best on Adafruit boards with built-in resistive touchscreen displays such as the PyPortal Titano, but could be easily adapted for other boards with larger displays. The emulator code is augmented by the micropython `udecimal` library adapted for CircuitPython by @jepler (Thank you!).
