class Touchscreen:
    """A driver for common and inexpensive resistive touchscreens. Analog input
    capable pins are required to read the intrinsic potentiometers

    Create the Touchscreen object. At a minimum you need the 4 pins
    that will connect to the 4 contacts on a screen. X and Y are just our
    names, you can rotate and flip the data if you like. All pins must be
    capable of becoming DigitalInOut pins. :attr:`y2_pin`, :attr:`x1_pin`
    and :attr:`x2_pin` must also be capable of becoming AnalogIn pins.
    If you know the resistance across the x1 and x2 pins when not touched,
    pass that in as 'x_resistance'.
    :attr:`calibration` is a tuple of two tuples, the default is
    ((0, 65535), (0, 65535)). The numbers are the min/max readings for the
    X and Y coordinate planes, respectively. To figure these out, pass in
    no calibration value or size value and read the raw minimum and maximum
    values out while touching the panel.
    :attr:`size` is a tuple that gives the X and Y pixel size of the underlying
    screen. If passed in, we will automatically scale/rotate so touches
    correspond to the graphical coordinate system.

    :param ~microcontroller.Pin x1_pin: Data pin for Left side of the screen.
     Must also be capable of becoming AnalogIn pins.
    :param ~microcontroller.Pin x2_pin: Data pin for Right side of the screen.
     Must also be capable of becoming AnalogIn pins.
    :param ~microcontroller.Pin y1_pin: Data pin for Bottom side of the screen.
    :param ~microcontroller.Pin y2_pin: Data pin for Top side of the screen.
     Must also be capable of becoming AnalogIn pins.
    :param int x_resistance: If you know the resistance across the x1 and x2
     pins when not touched, pass that in as :attr:`x_resistance`
    :param int  samples: change by adjusting :attr:`samples` arg. Defaults to :const:`4`
    :param int z_threshold: We can also detect the 'z' threshold, how much
     its pressed. We don't register a touch unless its higher than :attr:`z_threshold`
    :param (int,int),(int,int) calibration: A tuple of two tuples The numbers are the min/max
     readings for the X and Y coordinate planes, respectively.
     Defaults to :const:`((0, 65535), (0, 65535))`
    :param int,int size: The dimensions of the screen as (x, y).
